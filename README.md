## Classification with BERT using PyTorch
This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for spam classification using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to leverage the power of BERT to accurately classify text messages as either spam or non-spam.

###  Overview
Spam classification is an essential task in natural language processing that involves identifying and categorizing text messages or emails as spam or legitimate. This project focuses on utilizing BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to perform spam classification with high accuracy and robustness.

### Features
